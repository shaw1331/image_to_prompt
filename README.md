# ImageCaption

Image captioning model in pytorch using Resnet50 as encoder and LSTM as decoder.


### Dataset
- Create a specific folder in ROOT path (for example 'images') for images.
- Captions were split 70/30 into ```train_list.txt``` and ```val_list.txt```.

<br>

### How to run this code

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) to be installed on your computer.
```
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/shaw1331/ImageCaption_Flickr30k
```

<br>

I have generated ```requirements.txt``` using ```pipreqs```:

```python
> python -m  pipreqs.pipreqs --encoding utf-8 C:/Users/shaw1331/NN_projects/image_to_prompt/code/
```

**Note**: I prefer using ```pipreqs``` more than ```pip freeze```, as ```pip freeze``` saves all packages in the environment including those that you don't use in your current project. However, ```pipreqs only``` save the ones you are using in your project.

<br>

To install the requirements use:

```python
> pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

<br>

## Vocabulary

To build a vocabulary with *word2index* and *index2word* dictionaries, run:
```
vocab.py captions.txt vocabulary.txt 5000
``` 

where the first argument defines the text file from which the vocabulary will be built, the second defines the text file in which the *word2index* dictionary will be saved and the last defines the vocabulary size (including the 4 predefined tokens: ```<pad>```, ```<sos>```, ```<eos>``` and ```<unk>```)

<br>

## Dataset

Custom class ```ImageCaptionDataset()``` holds a list of samples where each sample is a dictionary containing the image file ID and the caption of that image as a list of word indices. The caption is enriched by ```<sos>``` and ```<eos>``` token at the beggining and end of caption respectively. 

The ```__getitem__``` returns an image (preprocessed, as tensor) and the caption as a list of word indices.

<br>

The function:
```python
get_data_loader(train_data, batch_size = config.BATCH, pad_index = vocab.PADDING_INDEX)
``` 
returns a data loader where each caption in a batch is padded with ```vocab.PADDING_INDEX``` which is in this case ```0``` to reach the length of longest caption in the batch (using ```pad_sequence```)

<br>

You can check the data loader by running ```dataset.py```

## Model

The whole model consists of 3 parts:
- encoder
- embeddings
- decoder

Running ```model.py``` will perform one forward operation of the whole model (with randomly initialized inputs). The results might help you to understand the dimensions of the outputs better. 

<br>

### Encoder

Image encoder is used to obtain features from images. The encoder consists of pretrained Resnet50 model with the last layer removed, and a linear layer with the output dimension of 
```(IMAGE_EMB_DIM)```.

### Embeddings

Embedding layer is used to obtain embedded representation (as a dense vector) of captions of dimension ```(WORD_EMB_DIM)```.  When training the model, the embedding layer is updated to learn better word representations through the optimization process.


### Decoder

Decoder taking as input for the LSTM layer the concatenation of features obtained from the encoder and embedded captions obtained from the embedding layer. Hidden and cell states are zero initialized. Final classifier is a linear layer with output dimension of ```(VOCAB_SIZE)```.

**Note**: during the training and evaluation, the model is used to generate captions ***word-by-word***, therefore the dimension of the embedded captions before the concatenation will be ```(length = 1, BATCH, WORD_EMB_DIM)```, and the dimension of features will be ```(1, BATCH,  IMAGE_EMB_DIM)```. The hidden and cell states are initialized to a tensor of size ```(NUM_LAYER, BATCH, HIDDEN_DIM)``` where ```HIDDEN_DIM = IMAGE_EMB_DIM + WORD_EMB_DIM```.

<br>



## Configurations

For running other files it is necessary to check the ```config.py``` and change it accordingly to your wish and situation:

```python

self.DEVICE = torch.device("cuda:0")
        
self.BATCH = 32
self.EPOCHS = 5
        
self.VOCAB_FILE = 'word2index5000.txt'
self.VOCAB_SIZE = 5000
        
self.NUM_LAYER = 1
self.IMAGE_EMB_DIM = 512
self.WORD_EMB_DIM = 512
self.HIDDEN_DIM = 1024
self.LR = 0.001
        
self.EMBEDDING_WEIGHT_FILE = 'checkpoints/embeddings-32B-1024H-1L-e5.pt'
self.ENCODER_WEIGHT_FILE = 'checkpoints/encoder-32B-1024H-1L-e5.pt'
self.DECODER_WEIGHT_FILE = 'checkpoints/decoder-32B-1024H-1L-e5.pt'
        
self.ROOT = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'NN_projects', 'ImageCaption_Flickr30k') 

``` 

If not done already, create specific folder 'checkpoints' in 'code' folder to store weights of trained model.

<br>

## Training and evaluating data

To train the model run ```main.py```.
After training the model you can visualize the results on validation data by running ```test_show.py```. It will show the image along with the title containing real captions, generated captions and the BLEU score (1 and 2).

Model with **B = 32** and **HIDDEN_DIM = 1024**:

## Generating captions on sample image

Run ```predict_sample.py  sample_image.jpg``` to generate captions on an image (in ROOT path).

Model with **B = 32** and **HIDDEN_DIM = 1024**:
